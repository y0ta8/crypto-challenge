Simple encryption &amp; decryption tool built step by step.
# Crypto Challenge

This project is focused on building an encryption and decryption tool using different cryptographic algorithms. Every week, a new algorithm will be implemented and added to the tool.

## Weekly Plan
1. **Week 1**: Caesar Cipher (Encode/Decode)
2. **Week 2**: Vigen√®re Cipher
3. **Week 3**: Base64 Encoding/Decoding
4. **Week 4**: File Encryption
5. **Week 5**: CLI/GUI Interface
6. **Week 6**: Final Polishing and Documentation

## Usage
1. Clone the repo.
2. Run the `main.py` file.
3. Follow the prompts to encode or decode a message.
