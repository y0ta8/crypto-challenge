# Crypto Challenge

This project is focused on building an encryption and decryption tool using different cryptographic algorithms. Every day, a new concept or feature will be implemented and added to the tool.

## 30-Day Plan

### ✅ Day 1: Caesar Cipher
- Implemented Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption
- Added brute-force decryption
- Integrated Caesar Cipher into the CLI tool

### ✅ Day 2: Vigenère Cipher
- Implemented Vigenère Cipher encryption and decryption
- Updated main.py to support Vigenère Cipher interaction

### ✅ Day 3: Base64 Encoding/Decoding
- Implemented Base64 encoding and decoding functionality using Python's `base64` module
- Added encode and decode functions to the CLI tool

### ✅ Day 4: Unit Testing & Validation
- Implemented unit tests for **Caesar Cipher**, **Vigenère Cipher**, and **Base64 Encoding/Decoding**.
- Ensured all algorithms are thoroughly tested for correctness and edge cases.
  
### ⏳ Day 5–30: More ciphers, file encryption, GUI, polish, and more!

## Usage
1. Clone the repo.
2. Run the `main.py` file.
3. Follow the prompts to encode or decode a message.

## Testing
To ensure the functionality of the algorithms, unit tests have been written and can be run with:

```bash
python test_crypto.py
