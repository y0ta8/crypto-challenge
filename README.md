# Crypto Challenge

This project is focused on building an encryption and decryption tool using different cryptographic algorithms. Every day, a new concept or feature will be implemented and added to the tool.

## 30-Day Plan

### ‚úÖ Day 1: Caesar Cipher
- Implemented Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption
- Added brute-force decryption
- Integrated Caesar Cipher into the CLI tool

### ‚úÖ Day 2: Vigen√®re Cipher
- Implemented Vigen√®re Cipher encryption and decryption
- Updated main.py to support Vigen√®re Cipher interaction

### üîÑ Day 3: Base64 Encoding/Decoding *(coming soon)*
### ‚è≥ Day 4‚Äì30: More ciphers, file encryption, GUI, polish, and more!

## Usage
1. Clone the repo.
2. Run the `main.py` file.
3. Follow the prompts to encode or decode a message.
